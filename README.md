Investigating the Gapminder World Dataset: <br> On Sustainable Development
==========================================================================

Introduction

### Dataset

The Gapminder World dataset is about people from around the world. It
describes their lives using data from trustworthy sources, such as the
UN. The *raison d'Ãªtre* of this dataset is to reduce the gap between
between popular misconception and reality. A topic rife with
misconception is human progress and development. These sorts of
misconceptions can be addressed using the Sustainable Development Index
(SDI), which includes 164 countries going back three decades. This
investigation uses [ver. 2 of the SDI data](http://gapm.io/dsdi), which
includes three tables of supporting data. Two are used in the
investigation.

### Preliminary Questions

-   What are the top countries when it comes to sustainable development?
-   How do they stack up against the most developed countries?

Summary of [Findings](https://raw.githack.com/fyasdani/sdi-investigation/main/investigate_a_dataset.html)
-------------------

-   Highly developed countries tend to struggle with sustainable
    development.
-   Underdeveloped countries struggle with sustainability too, making
    even less efficient use of resources---albeit at a much smaller
    scale.
-   The countries in between are the best at sustainable development.
    They live relatively efficiently and within their means.
-   The function of GNIpc is asymptotic as it pertains to human
    development.
    -   Thus, a country can be top-tier in terms of development, without
        being top-tier in terms of income per capita.
-   No rich countries stand out in terms of sustainability, not even
    relative to their level of per capita income.\*

\*At least not without offloading the environmental costs or performing
sleight of hand.
